Retail Customer Segmentation & Sales Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce customer transaction data using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer segments. The analysis is further supported by an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualize segment-wise insights and behaviors, assisting businesses in data-driven decision-making for customer targeting and retention strategies.

Objective

To develop a customer segmentation model that classifies customers based on purchasing behavior, helping marketing and sales teams target different customer groups more effectively.

Project Summary

- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on real-world e-commerce data to uncover trends and irregularities.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data, addressing null values, duplicates, cancellations, and outliers.
- Calculated RFM metrics to quantify customer behavior over time.
- Applied K-Means clustering to group customers into actionable segments.

Methodology

1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
- Dataset: [UCI Online Retail Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail)
- Removed missing customer IDs, negative quantities (returns), and cancelled invoices.
- Converted date fields and created additional date-based features.

2. RFM Analysis
- Recency: Days since the last purchase.
- Frequency: Total number of purchases.
- Monetary: Total amount spent.
- Each customer was scored and ranked using quantile-based segmentation.

3. Customer Segmentation with K-Means
- Used Elbow Method and Silhouette Score to determine optimal number of clusters.
- Applied K-Means to standardized RFM data.
- Clustered customers into 4 segments based on behavioral patterns.

 4. Insights & Business Interpretation
- Plotted boxplots and bar charts to compare clusters.
- Identified high-value, at-risk, and potential churn customers.
- Suggested actionable marketing strategies for each group.

 5. Streamlit Dashboard
- Built an interactive dashboard to display:
  - Cluster distribution
  - Customer-level RFM scores
  - Visual breakdowns for each segment
- Enables business users to explore data without writing code.

 Key Insights

- Cluster 0: High-value frequent buyers â€” suitable for loyalty rewards.
- Cluster 1: Recent but low-frequency buyers â€” ideal for cross-sell promotions.
- Cluster 2: Inactive customers â€” need reactivation campaigns.
- Cluster 3: Low engagement & low spend â€” may be deprioritized in campaigns.

Tools & Technologies

- Languages : Python  
- Libraries : Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Streamlit  
- Environment : Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab  
- Version Control : Git & GitHub

 

Final Deliverables

- Cleaned dataset (`rfm_clustered.csv`)
- Four well-documented Jupyter notebooks
- Streamlit dashboard for business insights
- PDF report summarizing the entire pipeline and conclusions
- GitHub repository with structured folders and README

 Note

This project is intended to showcase skills in data analysis, segmentation modeling, dashboard creation, and business communication. It can be extended by integrating predictive modeling, web scraping, or real-time customer data APIs in future versions.
